# Breakout Game

This project implements the classic Breakout arcade game using Python and Pygame.

## Methodology

The project follows these main steps:

1. **Game Setup:**
   - Initializing the game window and setting up game parameters.
   - Creating the paddle, ball, and brick layout.

2. **Game Logic:**
   - Handling user input for paddle movement.
   - Implementing ball physics and collision detection.
   - Managing brick destruction and score tracking.

3. **Game State Management:**
   - Keeping track of lives, score, and level progression.
   - Managing game over and win conditions.

4. **Rendering:**
   - Drawing the game elements (paddle, ball, bricks).
   - Updating the display based on game state.

## Results

The result is a playable Breakout game where players can:
- Move the paddle to bounce the ball.
- Break bricks to score points.
- Progress through levels of increasing difficulty.
- Aim for a high score while managing limited lives.

## Usage

To run the game, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies:
   - Python 3.x
   - Pygame
2. Clone the repository
  `git clone https://github.com/duongngothuy/Game-breakout.git`

3. Navigate to the project directory:
   `cd Game-breakout`

5. Run the game:
   - Use arrow keys or mouse to move the paddle.
   - Break all bricks to advance to the next level.
   - Avoid letting the ball fall below the paddle.

## Future Work

- Implement power-ups and special bricks.
- Add sound effects and background music.
- Create a level editor for custom brick layouts.
- Implement a high score system with player names.
